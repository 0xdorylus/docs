# Knowledge Base

A knowledge base is a module used to manage external data. External data can assist the intelligent agent in providing better services to users and offering more precise information.

## Importing Files

After importing external data (local files, real-time online data) into the knowledge base, the system will automatically segment the documents into several pieces for storage. Once the intelligent agent is associated with external data, it can retrieve the most relevant content from the documents through vector search, providing users with more accurate answers.

The file types planned to be supported for import include:
- Local files: You can upload local content stored in formats such as .txt, .pdf, .docx, .csv, and .xls to the knowledge base.

- Online websites: You can add online content from specified websites to the knowledge base.

- API: You can upload JSON data to the knowledge base via an API.

- Custom: You can manually upload your own data to the knowledge base.

## Application Scenarios

Once the intelligent agent is associated with the knowledge base, it will have a greater application value and convenience. By learning and receiving new information, the intelligent agent can update and expand the knowledge base to answer user needs in a more comprehensive and in-depth manner.
For example:
- Rich historical data makes the intelligent agent more accurate and detailed when answering questions about historical events or figures.
- In customer service scenarios, the intelligent agent can quickly resolve user issues, improving service efficiency.
- For complex or specific questions, the intelligent agent can reason and answer based on the knowledge base.
- In vertical fields, the intelligent agent uses specific domain knowledge bases to provide professional and precise services, such as in the medical field, offering scientific advice and guidance based on disease symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment methods.
In summary, the intelligent agent associated with the knowledge base can more effectively meet user needs, provide more accurate information or answers, and improve work efficiency in various application scenarios.

Here are examples of application scenarios for different fields:

- Education scenario: Create a database containing knowledge from textbooks at various educational stages. When students have questions about a particular subject or knowledge point, the intelligent agent can provide detailed and accurate answers by querying the knowledge base.
- Medical and health scenario: Create a knowledge base containing medical knowledge such as various disease symptoms and treatment methods. When users inquire about their own symptoms or treatment methods for a certain disease, the intelligent agent can quickly return relevant medical information.
- E-commerce shopping scenario: Establish a commercial knowledge base containing detailed product descriptions, reviews, and guides. When consumers ask about detailed information or user experience of a certain product, the intelligent agent can immediately provide corresponding consumer advice and product details.
- Entertainment scenario: Create a knowledge base containing entertainment resources such as movies, music, and books. When users are looking for entertainment recommendations or detailed information about a certain movie, the intelligent agent can recall relevant recommendations and information from the knowledge base.
- Financial scenario: Establish a knowledge base containing information on various financial products, investment strategies, and market trends. When users need financial advice or inquire about specific information about a financial product, the intelligent agent can provide professional and accurate financial consulting.# Knowledge Base
